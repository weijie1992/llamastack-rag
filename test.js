Before the cancellation information is captured, the user should verify the supporting documents. If FW passes manual verification, the work permit cancellation will be processed. Scope of Document This page can be used for both temporary and permanent cancellation but not for revocation. This page also serves individual and block cancellation. This page also caters for user to process cases where work permit is revoked, expired or previously cancelled. Context Diagram If user access the OS fine page from the block panel, the system always leads back to Cancel WP page and revalidate cancel records. If OS Fine has been imposed, no more hyperlink to OS Fine page on the same day, and system will disallow user to impose OS Fine again. If the user access the OS fine page from the individual panel, the system will auto close the OS fine page and user can process the case after OS fine form has been printed. After verifying the SB hardcopy from the SB Worker Details page, system will lead user back to Cancel WP page for user to continue the cancellation processing.
